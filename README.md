### To run Guitar:
For Windows: <br>
Install numpy, pygame and setuptools which can be done using `pip install numpy`, `pip install pygame` and `pip install setuptools` <br>

1. Download all files from `main` and save to a folder
2. Open terminal and go into the `introcs-1.0` folder
3. Run `python setup.py install --user`
4. Run `python`
5. At the Python `>>>` prompt enter in `import stdio`. If no errors show up, it means it's successful.
6. Now step out of the folder and use the command `python p4-heroine.py` to run the game!

For Linux: <br>
`python3 -m pip install -U numpy --user` <br>
`python3 -m pip install -U setuptools --user` <br>
`python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user` <br>
Then navigate to the `introcs-1.0` folder and run `python3 setup.py install --user`<br>
Follow step 6 for Windows.
